        Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, 
        breathe oxygen, are able to move, reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, 
        the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been 
        described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million
        in total. Animals range in size from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft) long and have 
        complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The study 
        of animals is called zoology.

        Animals may be listed or indexed by many criteria, including taxonomy, status as endangered species, 
        their geographical location, and their portrayal and/or naming in human culture.
